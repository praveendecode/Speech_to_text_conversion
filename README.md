# Speech Recognition and Data Analysis Script

     This Python script utilizes speech recognition to interactively query and analyze data using natural language processing techniques. It incorporates the Googletrans library for speech recognition, PyAudio for 
     audio input, and PandasAI for data analysis. Additionally, it uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model to provide answers to user queries.

# Prerequisites
      pip install googletrans==3.1.0a
      pip install SpeechRecognition
      pip install PyAudio
      pip install pandasai

# Code Process

         To use the script, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed and a CSV file named "diabetes.csv" in the script's directory. Run the script using Python, and it will prompt you to speak your 
         query. After speaking, it will display the recognized text and ask if you want to proceed with the query. Type "5" to proceed or "6" to speak again. Upon proceeding, the script will use PandasAI to analyze 
         the data and display the results. To stop the script, enter "2" when prompted.
         
         Please note that this script is intended for local use, as it relies on microphone input.
